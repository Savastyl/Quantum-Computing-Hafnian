# Quantum Random Number Generator Game

This is a  Python-based game that demonstrates the use of quantum computing to generate random numbers.
The game utilizes the PennyLane quantum computing library to create a quantum circuit that generates random bits.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.6 or later
- PennyLane

## Installation

1. Ensure that you have Python 3.6 or later installed on your system.

2. Install PennyLane using pip:

```
pip install pennylane
```

## Usage

1. Clone the repository or download the `quantum_random_game.py` file.

2. Run the game from the command line:

```
python quantum_random_game.py
```

3. Follow the prompts to guess the outcome of a random bit generated by a quantum circuit.

## How It Works

The game uses a simple quantum circuit consisting of a single qubit. The Hadamard gate is applied to the qubit, placing it in a superposition of states. When measured, the qubit has an equal probability of being in the |0> or |1> state, thus creating a random bit.

The user is asked to guess the outcome of this random bit. If the user's guess matches the quantum random number, they win the game; otherwise, they lose.
