# Quantum Computing:Hafnian - Game

Hafnian is a mathematical concept related to the calculation of the permanent of a matrix, which has found applications in quantum computing, particularly in Gaussian Boson Sampling. However, Hafnian itself is not a programming language or a framework for quantum computing.

If you would like to create a simple game for quantum computing, you can use a quantum computing framework, such as Qiskit, Cirq, or PennyLane. Here's a simple implementation of a quantum random number generator game using PennyLane, which has support for Gaussian Boson Sampling and Hafnian calculations.

This game asks the user to guess the output of a random bit generated by a quantum circuit. The user inputs their guess (0 or 1), and the program generates a random bit using a quantum circuit with PennyLane. If the user's guess matches the quantum random number, they win the game; otherwise, they lose.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.6 or later
- PennyLane

## Installation

1. Ensure that you have Python 3.6 or later installed on your system.

2. Install PennyLane using pip:

```
pip install pennylane
```

## Usage

1. Clone the repository or download the `quantum_random_game.py` file.

2. Run the game from the command line:

```
python quantum_random_game.py
```

3. Follow the prompts to guess the outcome of a random bit generated by a quantum circuit.

Note that this example does not explicitly use Hafnian calculations or Gaussian Boson Sampling, as these concepts are more advanced and typically not used in simple games. However, you can explore Gaussian Boson Sampling and Hafnian calculations using PennyLane by following the official documentation: https://pennylane.readthedocs.io/en/stable/introduction/photonic.html
